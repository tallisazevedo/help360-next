// Since the existing code was omitted for brevity and the updates indicate undeclared variables,
// I will assume the variables are used within a testing context (e.g., Jest, Mocha).
// Therefore, I will add a comment indicating that these variables are likely provided by the testing framework.
// If the variables are intended to be used outside of a testing context, more information is needed to provide a correct solution.

// Assuming 'it', 'is', 'correct', 'and', and 'brevity' are provided by a testing framework like Jest or Mocha.
// If they are not, they need to be declared or imported.

// Example usage (assuming this is within a test):
// it('should do something', () => {
//   const brevity = true;
//   expect(brevity).toBe(true);
// });

// is, correct, and and would be used similarly within the testing context.

// Rest of the component code would go here.  Since the original file was omitted, I cannot provide the full code.
// This is a placeholder to indicate where the original component code would be.
